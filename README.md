## About the Book
Kotlin is a powerful language that has applications in a wide variety of fields. It is a concise, safe, interoperable and tool friendly language. Also, the Android team has announced first-class support for Kotlin which acts as an added boost to the language. With this book, you will get a deep understanding of this robust programming language and how it can make your life easier. This collection of projects will demonstrate the versatility of the language and enable you to build standalone applications on your own.

The book starts by unveiling the latest features of Kotlin and quickly walks you through the building blocks that form the basis of writing applications. You will build comprehensive applications in the book using the various features of Kotlin. Scale, performance, and high availability lie at the heart of the projects, and the lessons learned throughout this book will arm you with everything you need to build world-class solutions. You will learn to build a social media aggregator app that will help you efficiently track various feeds, develop a geospatial webservice with Kotlin and Spring, build onlines games like Pokemon, build responsive web applications with Kotlin, build a server side application with Kotlin. The book also covers the various libraries and frameworks in these projects.Through the course of building applications, this book will not only help you get to grips with the various features of Kotlin, but will also teach you how to design and prototype professional-grade applications with performance and security considerations.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
repositories { 
    maven { 
        url 'https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone' 
    } 
}  
dependencies { 
    compile 'org.springframework:spring-context:5.0.0.RC4' 
 
} 
```

To get the most of this book, read it slowly and carefully and do each of the examples we do. 
Try to understand what is the point of the given example and how you would use it as a base to build something bigger.
Also, as always, code as much as you can!
